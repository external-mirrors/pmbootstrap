# Environment Variables

## `PMB_SUDO`

pmbootstrap supports `doas` and `sudo`. If multiple sudo implementations are
installed, pmbootstrap will use `doas`. You can set the `PMB_SUDO`
environmental variable to define the sudo implementation you want to use.

## `PMB_APK_FORCE_MISSING_REPOSITORIES`

When this is set to `1`, pmbootstrap will not complain if downloading an
APKINDEX results in a 404 not found error. This is used by
[bpo](https://build.postmarketos.org) when building a new stable repository for
the first time. For example if the `x86_64` repository was already built and
published, but the `aarch64` repository wasn't published yet.

## `PMB_APK_NO_CACHE`

When this is set to `1`, pmbootstrap will disable apk's caching feature. This
is used by bpo for image build jobs, so these jobs don't need as much space.

## `PMB_CHANNELS_CFG`

Set this variable to the path of a copy of
[channels.cfg](https://gitlab.postmarketos.org/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/blob/master/channels.cfg)
on disk to have pmbootstrap read it from there instead of `origin/master` from
pmaports. This is used by bpo with shallow clones of pmaports, where the master
branch may not be available (e.g. when building packages for a release branch).

## `PMB_FDE_PASSWORD`

This variable can be used to set the password when running `install --fde`. The
password is written to a temporary file and can be read from
`/proc/<pid>/environ`. Make sure you are aware of the security implications,
consider using this feature only with test passwords or in environments such as
live operating systems running in memory.
