Welcome to pmbootstrap's documentation!
=======================================

pmbootstrap is the central command-line application for postmarketOS development. Among other things,
it allows building packages, creating installation images and flashing them to your device. If you just want to install
postmarketOS, read the `Installation`_ wiki article first since you might not need pmbootstrap depending on the method.

For the latest releases please check the `repository`_.

In case of any problems, have a look at the `issue-tracker`_.
